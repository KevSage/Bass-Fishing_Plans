     1. Where (targets / positioning)
     2. How (cadence / movement)
     3. When (timing / progression)
   - Gear included inline
   - Uses spaced clarifiers (never stacked)

3. **Pattern 2 — Counter-Condition Pattern**
   - Smaller hero image
   - Must target a *different fish position* AND *different presentation family*
   - Full instruction, reduced length
   - Never fishes the same water the same way

4. **Alternates (Same Presentation Family Only)**
   - Small thumbnails
   - No new logic introduced

5. **Day Progression**
   - Morning / Midday / Late
